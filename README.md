# DAWN

This repository contains the codes described in our paper
"Exploiting Differences and Analogies Between Cold Items and Neighbors for Item Recommendation".

The codes were tested in Tensorflow 2.6 with python 3.9.

In addition to Tensorflow, numpy, pandas, tqdm, sklearn, scipy, pickle are installed to your system before you run the source codes.

Thank you.
